<strong><p align="center">Kanna is a small, light and great to use terminal shell for Windows.</p></strong>

Kanna is a fast and lightweight shell for Windows that looks and acts like other shells on Linux. It has custom prompts which provide variables for colors, username, hostname (computer name) and current working directory.

It is still being developed but is currently very usable.
