This is the legacy version of Lunaria that is made in JavaScript with Node.js. For the new version, check the Hilbis organization.  

<strong>Lunaria is a simple, fast and lightweight terminal shell for Windows.</strong>

Its goal is to be quick and elegant, while also having the feel and look of a Linux shell.  
Lunaria provides: prompt and message of the day customization, extensibility (custom commands) and more to come.

# Installation
[A packaged binary is provided](https://github.com/Luvella/Lunaria/releases) if you don't have Node.js, or want easy usage.  
Otherwise:
```
git clone https://github.com/Luvella/Lunaria
cd Lunaria
npm link
```

## Tagged Overrides 
Running a command with `#` at the beginning will run the Windows provided version instead of Lunaria's custom implementation.  
Example: `ls` - This runs our implementation.  
`#ls` - would run Windows' normal `ls` command.

## Config
The config file is located in the `Lunaria` folder in your user folder (Example: `C:\Users\person\Lunaria`). The file is `conf.json`.  
This is also where custom commands can go, in the Commands directory (`C:\Users\person\Lunaria\Commands`)

#### Values for conf.json
`askOnExit` - Whether to ask for confirmation to exit with ctrl+c (Default: true)
