<strong><p align="center">Kanna is a small, light and great to use terminal shell for Windows.</p></strong>

Kanna is by default supposed to be a lightweight and quick shell that looks like other shells on Linux. It has custom prompts which provide variables for colors, username, hostname (computer name) and current working directory.

It is still being developed but is currently very usable (if you don't mind missing tab for directories).
